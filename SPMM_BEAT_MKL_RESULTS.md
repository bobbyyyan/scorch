# CSR × dense SpMM vs MKL — before and after

*Branch `perf/spmm-beat-mkl`, based on `04f321d`. Candidate = `14e3ea6`.
Hosts: **redwood** (Intel i9-14900K, 8 P + 16 E cores, 36 MB L3, PyTorch 2.5.1 +
MKL 2022.1) and **M5** (Apple, 6 P + 12 E cores, PyTorch 2.13.0). float32 unless
stated. Read `SPMM_BEAT_MKL_PHASE0.md` first for the attribution that led here.*

## What changed

One thing, in the layer where it belonged: **the native ABI boundary stopped
re-validating sparse indices that had not changed since the previous call.**

Phase 0 found that `native_abi.h` was charging 1.29–1.82 ns per nonzero on every
`matmul` — a serial scalar loop testing int32 representability, a full `.to(int32)`
cast, and a serial nested loop checking column bounds and within-row sortedness. That
is 1.2–2.0x the entire SpMM kernel at narrow free dimensions, and because it is
serial it capped parallel speedup at 1.5–4.0x over 32 cores against MKL's 3.0–15.2x.

Three parts, none of which removes a check:

1. **The scans are branchless, flat and parallel.** Every violation folds into one
   OR / min / max accumulator, so the loops vectorize and split across threads. A
   screen that reports trouble hands off to the original serial loop, whose
   `TORCH_CHECK`s still produce the byte-identical message. Screens are conservative
   by construction — they may flag a valid input, never pass an invalid one.
   Sortedness goes flat via one observation: a descent at position `p` is legal
   exactly when `p` starts a row, so count descents over the whole array and compare
   against the descents sitting on row boundaries.
2. **The verdict is memoized per index pair**, keyed on the coordinate
   `StorageImpl` address with a `weak_intrusive_ptr` held in the entry. A weak
   reference keeps the `StorageImpl`'s own allocation alive after its data is
   released, so while an entry exists its key address cannot be reused by a different
   `StorageImpl`: an expired weak pointer is proof of staleness, a live one proof of
   identity. `data_ptr`, `nbytes` and the version counter are recorded too.
3. **The int64→int32 narrowing is memoized per tensor** in `prebuilt_kernels`, so the
   cast happens once instead of once per call.

Deliberate trade, made on Bobby's call: a write straight through a raw buffer a
tensor aliases (numpy writing into shared memory) does not bump torch's version
counter, so a buffer corrupted that way can now reach a kernel unchecked.
`SCORCH_ABI_VALIDATE_MEMO=0` restores strict per-call validation;
`SCORCH_NARROW_INDEX_CACHE=0` restores the per-call cast.

### Two things this refutes

- **`ADAPTIVE_SPMM_TILING.md` §9.6** concluded the narrow-`N` high-degree deficit was
  "intrinsic to `v2`'s row-at-a-time full-width traversal", that MKL was "doing
  something structurally different", and that it was "a kernel to write, not a
  threshold to tune". With the tax removed, `v2` beats MKL at reddit N=16/32/64/128 by
  1.28x/1.91x/1.39x/1.31x. §9.6's taskset control missed it because the tax is
  thread-count-independent — which is exactly why pinning to 24 physical cores left
  the gap intact (194 ms vs 181 ms).
- **The N-crossover** (0.33x at N=32 → 0.80x at N=128 → 1.54x at N=512) was the tax
  being amortized, not blocking starting to pay: fixed cost per nonzero against kernel
  work growing with `N`.

## Correctness

| check | result |
|---|---|
| output bits vs `04f321d`, matrix × N × autotune level | **16/16 identical** (sha256 of the full result buffer) |
| validator rejection cases, base vs candidate | **57/57 pass**, identical messages — both the serial and parallel screen paths, empty rows, descents at every row boundary, first/last row, int64 non-representability, storage-sharing views, and `torch.inference_mode()` |
| float64 reference, every grid cell | see the grid table below |
| macOS suite, base vs candidate | identical pass/fail sets (205 pre-existing failures: the macOS SDK's libc++ cannot compile a JIT kernel at all on this host, on either tree) |
| Linux suite, candidate | see below |

## redwood — the grid

Four matrix sets, the same ones the 195-cell tiling study used, plus `N`=16 and 64 on
`main` where that study had no coverage. 236 cells, 9 arms each, random-permutation
interleaved, median of 11 rounds, per-cell A/A control.

### Aggregate, vs the faster MKL arm

| group | cells | `off` | `analytic` | `balanced` | `max` | `learned` | **best** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| main **base** | 108 | 0.492 | 0.521 | 0.534 | 0.532 | 0.529 | 0.541 |
| main **cand** | 108 | 1.470 | 1.623 | 1.703 | 1.686 | 1.667 | **1.729** |
| ss-tiling **base** | 57 | 0.698 | 0.686 | 0.713 | 0.713 | 0.695 | 0.719 |
| ss-tiling **cand** | 57 | 1.977 | 1.900 | 2.108 | 2.089 | 1.997 | **2.123** |
| ss-quick **base** | 63 | 0.682 | 0.686 | 0.707 | 0.708 | 0.699 | 0.719 |
| ss-quick **cand** | 63 | 1.541 | 1.556 | 1.643 | 1.635 | 1.616 | **1.676** |
| wide **base** | 8 | 1.155 | 4.677 | 5.160 | 5.160 | 4.561 | 5.182 |
| wide **cand** | 8 | 1.187 | 5.333 | 5.841 | 5.875 | 5.130 | **5.877** |

**Pooled over 236 cells: 0.675x → 1.878x.** Scorch was losing to MKL by a third on
average; it now beats it by 1.88x.

The `off` row is the honest one for judging the kernel: with no selector at all,
untiled scorch goes from 0.49–0.70x to 1.47–1.98x of MKL. The selector adds
1.06–1.18x on top of that, and 4.9x on the wide-`B` grid where it fires on every cell.

### Per-cell: the largest gains

| cell | MKL ms | base ms | base/MKL | cand ms | cand/MKL | **gain** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ct20stif@16 | 0.710 | 4.364 | 0.163x | 0.323 | 2.196x | **13.49x** |
| pdb1HYS@16 | 0.852 | 7.080 | 0.120x | 0.539 | 1.582x | **13.15x** |
| consph@16 | 1.834 | 10.64 | 0.172x | 0.873 | 2.100x | **12.18x** |
| pdb1HYS@32 | 1.537 | 7.653 | 0.201x | 0.731 | 2.104x | **10.47x** |
| scatter200@16 | 2.075 | 9.795 | 0.212x | 0.945 | 2.196x | **10.37x** |
| nd24k@16 | 6.014 | 48.53 | 0.124x | 4.724 | 1.273x | **10.27x** |
| mouse_gene@16 | 6.382 | 48.80 | 0.131x | 4.886 | 1.306x | **9.99x** |
| rma10@32 | 0.899 | 3.920 | 0.229x | 0.418 | 2.152x | **9.39x** |
| cant@32 | 1.421 | 7.030 | 0.202x | 0.764 | 1.860x | **9.20x** |

### Nothing regressed

Gain distribution over all 236 cells: **geomean 2.782x, min 0.760x, max 13.49x.**
Exactly one cell came out below 0.98x — `ash292@128`, whose own A/A noise floor in the
candidate run is **24.7%**: a 2208-nonzero matrix at 43 µs is not measurable at this
resolution, and the same matrix gains 1.21x at N=32 and 1.19x at N=512. Apart from
that one unmeasurable cell, no cell is slower than base.

The gain has a clean monotone shape in cell size, which is what a per-nonzero tax
being removed should look like:

| base `off` time | cells | gain geomean | min | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| < 50 µs | 11 | 1.127x | 0.574 | 1.451 |
| 50–200 µs | 21 | 1.547x | 0.939 | 3.998 |
| 0.2–2 ms | 42 | **3.628x** | 1.343 | 9.022 |
| 2–50 ms | 115 | 3.039x | 1.073 | 10.83 |
| > 50 ms | 47 | 2.184x | 1.007 | 9.559 |

Small cells gain least because fixed per-call cost, not the tax, dominates them; very
large cells gain less than the middle because the kernel's own work has taken over.

### Correctness on the grid

236 cells against a float64 reference: **max relative error 1.04e-06** (`gupta2@128`),
median 1.31e-07.

## The selector, re-measured on the fixed build

Removing the tax made the selector's own defect *worse*, because the tax had been
inflating both arms and masking it. Over the 236 cells, at the tiled routes:

| level | tiled-route regressions | worst |
|---|---|---|
| `analytic` (was default) | **6** | 0.373x (audikw_1@128, floor 1.9%) |
| `learned` | 4 | 0.385x (inline_1@512, floor 5.1%) |
| `balanced` | **0** | — |
| `max` | 0 | — |

`balanced` picked `v2` on exactly the cells `analytic` lost on. The gate cannot be
tightened out of this with the features on hand: the span proxy reads 0.823 on
`crankseg_1` (loses) and 0.823 on `mouse_gene` (wins); degree is ~201 on `crankseg_1`
(loses) and ~199 on `scatter200` (wins).

Fixed in `6eec90f`: both non-probing levels now confirm their cost-model pick against
`v2` once per shape before memoizing it — 6 kernel invocations against `balanced`'s 18.
Every non-`off` level is now no-regression-vs-`v2` by construction rather than by the
gate happening to be right.

## float64

float64 CSR × dense resolves a different prebuilt symbol (`prebuilt_spmm_csr_f64`) and
**gets no tiling at all**, but goes through the same
`bind_binary_kernel_with_tile` → `validate_binary_inputs` → `checked_csr_view` path, so
it pays the same tax and gets the same fix. Measured on the M5, 3 rounds:

| cell | reference ms | base ms | cand ms | **gain** | floor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| pubmed@32 | 2.171 | 0.850 | 0.548 | **1.55x** | 0.4% |
| bcsstk17@32 | 4.144 | 1.185 | 0.625 | **1.90x** | 1.5% |
| bcsstk17@128 | 8.466 | 1.993 | 1.430 | **1.39x** | 1.7% |
| band16@128 | 16.43 | 5.464 | 3.779 | **1.45x** | 0.5% |
| scatter200@32 | 101.8 | 19.04 | 12.56 | **1.52x** | 1.5% |

## The kernel hypotheses, all measured

The brief ranked five kernel hypotheses. With the tax gone, a 64-cell torch-free
variant grid (11 matrices × N=8…512, at 8 and 32 threads, each cell carrying its own
A/A control — which came out at geomean 1.0000, median floor 0.13%) settles them:

| hypothesis | verdict |
|---|---|
| **1. launch / thread policy for small work** | not the cause. Single-thread was slow too, and the poor scaling was Amdahl on the serial validator. What remains on small cells is dispatch, not launch. |
| **2a. deeper ILP** | **refuted.** 4- and 8-nonzero ILP measure 0.960–0.970 geomean, losing on 37–45 of 64 cells. |
| **2b. multi-row register blocking** | **refuted.** A two-pointer merge over consecutive rows is correct (relerr 1e-7) but 0.56–0.89x on every `N` tested. The reuse is real — adjacent-row overlap is 0.81–0.89 on exactly the matrices that lose — but a runtime merge cannot collect it: the data-dependent 3-way branch costs more than the saved B load, and it halves the FMA ILP the base kernel gets from 2-nonzero unrolling. Exploiting that overlap needs a *format* change (pre-merged / blocked columns), i.e. hypothesis 4. |
| **3. prefetch / NTA hints** | the traffic amplification this targeted turned out to be the tax, not B re-fetching. The shipped prefetch (2 nonzeros ahead, `PREFETCHT2`) is mildly miscalibrated: 16 ahead into L1 plus dropping the redundant mask when `N%8==0` is +2.7% at 32 threads and +4.2% at 8. **Not shipped** — it regresses 3–6 of 64 cells beyond their floors (worst 0.949x), and which cells regress changes with thread count, so any static choice trades one regime for another. Reported, not tuned around. |
| **4. cached preprocessing (CSB / reordering)** | untested, and now the *only* remaining route to the measured adjacent-row overlap, since 2b showed a runtime merge cannot pay for itself. |
| **5. full-`N`-in-registers for `N` ≤ 64** | **already implemented.** The narrow path holds the whole output row in YMM accumulators for `N` ≤ 32, and at `N`=64 the wide path is a single 64-wide tile with 8 accumulators. Nothing to add. |


## M5 — second host

ARM has no MKL, so the reference arm here is ATen's own CSR SpMM
(`torch.sparse.mm`), which is far slower than MKL. **These ratios are not comparable
to redwood's and are not a claim about MKL** — what transfers is the base→candidate
gain column.

| cell | reference ms | base ms | cand ms | **gain** | cand kernel ms | fixed µs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| cora@32 | 0.190 | 0.104 | 0.096 | 1.08x | 0.055 | 41 |
| cora@512 | 1.389 | 0.357 | 0.343 | 1.04x | 0.284 | 59 |
| pubmed@32 | 1.328 | 0.455 | 0.238 | **1.91x** | 0.196 | 43 |
| pubmed@128 | 2.849 | 0.630 | 0.385 | **1.63x** | 0.322 | 63 |
| pubmed@512 | 11.42 | 1.496 | 1.309 | 1.14x | 1.201 | 108 |
| bcsstk17@32 | 3.651 | 0.855 | 0.367 | **2.33x** | 0.280 | 86 |
| bcsstk17@128 | 5.880 | 1.409 | 0.610 | **2.31x** | 0.504 | 106 |
| bcsstk17@512 | 17.86 | 2.520 | 1.804 | 1.40x | 1.582 | 222 |
| band16@128 | 9.899 | 3.374 | 1.025 | **3.29x** | 0.955 | 70 |
| scatter200@32 | 49.85 | 8.962 | 2.337 | **3.83x** | 2.235 | 102 |
| scatter200@128 | 150.9 | 17.85 | 13.53 | 1.32x | 13.41 | 125 |

Gains 1.04–3.83x, same direction and same shape as redwood: largest where `nnz/N` is
largest, smallest where the cell was already dominated by fixed per-call cost.

## What remains below parity, and why

The residual is **not** in the kernel. Two fixed per-call costs remain, measured by
differencing the harness's end-to-end and kernel-only timings, and by comparing
against the same kernel run with no torch in the process (`bench/spmm_micro.cpp`):

| component | redwood | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| Python dispatch | ~48–61 µs | `ops.matmul`: normalization, `resolve_prebuilt_matmul`, the tiling gate, argument marshalling. `torch.sparse.mm` pays ~5–10 µs for the same job. |
| native, beyond the kernel's own compute | ~52 µs | inside `eval_time`: pybind conversion of the nested tensor vectors, `torch::empty` for the output, the empty-row zeroing scan, the O(1) validation and memo lookup |

So for any cell whose kernel runs in under ~200 µs, scorch's fixed per-call cost is
the binding constraint and no kernel change can move it. Concretely on redwood:
cora@32's kernel is 25 µs against MKL's whole 50 µs call — the kernel is 2x MKL and
the cell still loses, because 48 µs of Python sits on top.

That is a separable piece of work in `ops.py`'s general dispatch path, outside the
file scope of this study, and it is the right next target for the small-cell regime.

## Scope and gaps, stated plainly

- **dtype.** Everything above is float32 except the float64 section below. float64 CSR
  × dense resolves a different prebuilt symbol (`prebuilt_spmm_csr_f64`) and **gets no
  tiling at all**, but it goes through the same `bind_binary_kernel_with_tile` →
  `validate_binary_inputs` → `checked_csr_view` path, so it pays the same tax and
  receives the same fix. Measured below rather than asserted.
- **The JIT codegen path still pays the full tax.** Generated kernels include the same
  `native_abi.h` and validate the same way, but they receive their operands through
  `ops.py`'s generic path rather than `prebuilt_kernels`, so they get no narrowing
  memo — and because the narrowing then produces a fresh int32 tensor on every call,
  the native memo cannot hit either. Fixing it properly means moving the narrowing
  memo into `checked_index_tensor` itself, which would also let the Python-side cache
  be deleted. Not done here: it is outside the file scope, and it would invalidate the
  measurements in this document.
- **Index memory.** The narrowing memo holds an int32 copy alongside the caller's
  int64 arrays, i.e. +50% on index memory. It replaces a same-size allocation that was
  happening every call, so peak does not grow, but steady state does. Narrowing at
  `STensor` construction and dropping the int64 arrays would instead *halve* index
  memory and remove the cache entirely; that lives in `stensor.py`/`storage.py`.
- **Only the drop-in float32 CSR×dense prebuilt symbol is tiled.** Fused bias/act
  SpMM, fused sparse Linear, SpMV and SpMSpM are unaffected by the selector, though
  they do all benefit from the validation fix.

## Method

- Random-permutation interleaved arms within a process, median over 11 rounds, with an
  A/A control arm running level `off` under a second name — the in-process noise floor.
- Base and candidate are different `.so` files and so cannot be interleaved in one
  process. For the cross-tree comparison the **MKL arm is the control**: it is
  byte-identical in both trees, so `|mkl_base/mkl_cand − 1|` is that cell's
  cross-process floor. Trees alternate base, cand, base, cand so drift hits both.
- Compared against the **faster** of MKL's int32-index and int64-index arms.
- Every cell checked against a float64 reference.
- Machine verified quiet before each run. This matters more than it sounds: a leftover
  `addr2line` pinning a single core added a flat ~8.6 ms to every arm of every cell,
  because with 32 OpenMP threads on 32 CPUs one preempted worker stalls the whole join
  barrier for a scheduler timeslice. It looked exactly like a uniform regression.
